# APA LaTeX
This repository provides you with LaTeX templates and a set of examples
for APA-style student papers and Bachelor's and Master's thesis. This has
been made in the hopes that it will make your first experience with LaTeX
a pleasant one.

## Why LaTeX ?

LaTeX is quite different from other word processing tools, e.g. *Microsoft
Word* and *OpenOffice*: you write your document as a set of machine-readable
instructions and then these instructions are processed to create the actual
file.

This may sound like much more of a hassle, but it comes with lots of benefits.
1. You do not need to think about styling-criteria again. LaTeX just makes
   sure everything is how and where it should be!
2. Citations are a breeze! No need to sweat about correct formatting, whether
   you already have cited said paper earlier and hence should format it
   differently, and all the other issues you are accostumed to.
3. Managing larger documents, e.g. a thesis, does not become unmanageable!

### How do I LaTeX ?

There are multiple ways, in which you can work with LaTeX.

#### In Your Browser

The easiest solution (since it requires you to install no software) is to use
the online tool [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) which essentially is a
Google Docs, but for LaTeX! This also makes it great for collaborative writing.

To use this template, copy over the desired *template__xxx.tex* and
*references.bib* file into a new project and you are ready to go.

#### On Your Computer

To create the final documents on your local machine you need an actual LaTeX
compiler and editor installed. This has the benefit that you can also work on
your documents when you have no internet connection, such as in some exam
situations.

- **Compiler**
  The compiler is the piece of software that converts your LaTeX instructions
  to the final document. The simplest LaTeX compiler to use (especially on Windows)
  is [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).

- **Editor**
  You then also need another program to actually modify the LaTeX files. You
  can do so merely with *notepad* or the editor that comes with *MiKTeX* and some
  other LaTeX compilers. But, [TeXMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
  is a much more pleasant tool to use.
